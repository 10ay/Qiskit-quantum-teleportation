    "Hermitian Conjugate $M^\\dagger$ of a matrix $M$ is the combination of the transpose and the complex conjugate of each element. Two families of matrices that are very important to quantum computing are defined by their relationship with the Hermitian conjugate. One is the family of unitary matrices, for which\n",

    "This means that the Hermitian conjugate of a unitary is its inverse. All gates in quantum computing, with the exception of measurement and reset operations, can be represented by unitary matrices. Unitary matrices also preserve the inner product. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = uni.png  width = 350 />\n",
    "\n",
    "This property provides us with a useful way of thinking about these gates. It means that for any set of states $\\{|\\psi_j\\rangle\\}$ that provides an orthonormal basis for our system, the set of states $\\{|\\phi_j\\rangle\\}=\\{U|\\psi_j\\rangle\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The unitary can then be thought of as a rotation between these bases. \n",

    "$ M = \\sum\\limits _{j} = \\lambda_j|h_j\\rangle\\langle h_j|$ where the $\\lambda_j$ are the eigenvalues of the matrix and $|h_j\\rangle$ are the corresponding eigenstates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For unitaries, applying the $UU\\dagger = I$ condition in this diagonal form implies that $\\lambda_j\\lambda_j^*=1$. The eigenvalues are therefore always complex numbers of magnitude 1, and so can be expressed $e^ih_j$ for some real value $h_j$. For hermitian matrices, $\\lambda_j=\\lambda_j^*$\n",
    "\n",
    "These two types of matrices therefore differ only in that one must have real numbers for eigenvalues, and the other must have complex exponentials of real numbers. This means that, for every unitary, we can define a corresponding Hermitian matrix. For this we simply reuse the same eiggenstates, and use the $h_j$ from each $e^ih_j$ as the corresponding eigenvalue.\n",

    "Similarly, for each Hermitian matrix there exists a unitary. We simply reuse the same eigenstates, and exponentiate the $h_j$ to create the eigenvalues $e^ih_j$. This can be expressed as:\n",
